## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Architecture Mismatch

**Challenge**: Initial attempts with `resnet_9blocks` and `unet_512` failed due to architecture incompatibility.

**Solution**: Used `unet_256` with 64 base filters, which matched the training configuration perfectly.

### 2. Checkpoint Path Issues

**Challenge**: Complex nested directory structure caused checkpoint loading failures.

**Solution**: Identified correct checkpoint path: `/checkpoints/model_name/model_name/latest_net_G.pth`

### 3. Generation Quantity

**Challenge**: Default `num_test=50` limited initial generation to 50 images.

**Solution**: Set `num_test=500` to generate the full desired dataset.

### 4. File Organization

**Challenge**: Complex file naming and directory structure made extraction difficult.

**Solution**: Created automated scripts for file extraction, renaming, and organization.
