- **`unet_evaluation_report.txt`** - Comprehensive evaluation analysis and insights
- **`unet_complete_summary.txt`** - Concise combined summary of training and evaluation

### Future Models (To be added)

- **`unetr_training_summary.txt`** - UNETR training results
- **`unetr_evaluation_report.txt`** - UNETR evaluation analysis
- **`unetr_complete_summary.txt`** - UNETR combined summary
- **`swinunetr_training_summary.txt`** - SwinUNETR training results
- **`swinunetr_evaluation_report.txt`** - SwinUNETR evaluation analysis
