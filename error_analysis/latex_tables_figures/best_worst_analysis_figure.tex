Comparative analysis showing the 5 most challenging (top row) and 5 easiest (bottom row) images based on average F1-scores across all models. Each image pair shows the enhanced original image and corresponding ground truth annotations. Challenging images typically exhibit: (1) low contrast requiring significant enhancement, (2) high cell density with overlapping boundaries, (3) irregular cell shapes and sizes. Easy images demonstrate: (1) clear contrast and well-defined boundaries, (2) moderate cell density with good separation, (3) consistent cell morphology. This analysis helps identify dataset characteristics that impact model performance and guides future data collection strategies.
