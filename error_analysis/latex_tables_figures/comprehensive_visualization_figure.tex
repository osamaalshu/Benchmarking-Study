Comprehensive 4Ã—7 visualization showing: (Column 1) Enhanced original image with improved contrast for challenging low-contrast images; (Column 2) Ground truth instance segmentation with 454 average cells per image; (Column 3) Model predictions for all 7 architectures with cell counts; (Column 4) Error overlay visualization with color-coded analysis: red = false negatives (missed cells), blue = false positives (incorrect detections), green = true positives (correct matches), black = background. Each row represents a different model, demonstrating varying performance across architectures. MAUNet variants (rows 5-7) show superior performance with fewer errors compared to traditional approaches.

Example of challenging low-contrast image analysis showing the effectiveness of image enhancement techniques and model robustness. Originally appearing as blank/white image, enhanced visualization reveals cellular structures enabling proper error analysis. Note the significant performance differences between models on difficult cases, with MAUNet architectures maintaining better detection capabilities compared to classical U-Net approaches.
